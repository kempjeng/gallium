* Paren groups
* Some way of binding functions/expressions to ordinary Go code
    - Specifically for builtins, but also for interop/optimizations?
        + Builtins are supportable by adding their signatures to the
          Environment and putting their full definitions into a sibling
          `builtins.go` file
* Imports
* Support for template expansion
* Type declarations
* Sum types
* Conditionals/matching
* Toplevel function let decls codegen into Go func decls
